**Usage**

First download the [ANTLR Toolset](https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar).

Change the input.csv the way you'd use an excel table. 
SUM: you can summorize numbers and expressions in your csv with this function.

Just write =SUM(A1:C1) as you see in the input.csv

After you changed the input.csv you need to run the makefile again with the command *make*
